DevelopHer Hackday 2013 Hangout App - BeeHives
==============================================
Mobile webapp that brings people together to hangout immediately. There are two different kind of users - active (Queen Bees) vs passive (bees). Passive users have the option to decide whether they are available to hangout or not. Active users are able suggest a hangout location and activity. An active user's request will be pinged to passive users to decide whether they are interested in hanging out at. The catch is that they have a time limit for how long a passive user is able to respond to a request.
