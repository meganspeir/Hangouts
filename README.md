DevelopHer Hackday 2013 - Flake
==============================================

The app was conceived as a mobile idea by @ingridavendano and was a collaborative effort at a 24 hour hackathon with @meganspeir, @nickelmu, @sharonw and @kahlouie using Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, The Facebook API and MapBox.

Flake is the app to connect you with friends nearby and coordinate spontaneous in-person hangouts.

Passive users have the option to decide whether they are available to hangout or not. Active users are able suggest a hangout location and activity. An active user's request will be pinged to passive users to decide whether they are interested in hanging out at. The catch is that they have a time limit for how long a passive user is able to respond to a request.
